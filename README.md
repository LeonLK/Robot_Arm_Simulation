# Robot_Arm_Simulation

This theses files are for the Matlab robot arm simulations for my RKD final projects.
The main folder is the "ringBot", which contains the class ringBot.m and and runBot.m to run the simulation
Other folders, as you can see from the names, are what I used to build this entire simulation in matlab. 
Functions such as foward Kinematics, Inverse Kinematics(numerical), and jacobians that are compatible with both revolute and primatics joints can be found in these folders.
